# MusicByNumbers-Android-Free
An android app which displays diagrams for learning piano scales.
Disclaimer I wrote this app 4 years ago before I really knew how to code, so it is pretty basic.
It provides a menu to select a piano scale and then displays the Music By Numbers diagram for that scale.
